Please refer the knowledgeGraph.java, there are API paths with mapping services. The api is use to solve the problem solved in question list.
For example, the 22th question in  question list has a corresponding api in knowledgeGraph.java as follow:
@RequestMapping(value = "/q22/{name1}/{name2}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public Map<String, Object> q22(@PathVariable String name1, @PathVariable String name2) {
        return paperService.q22(name1, name2);
    }
This fraction of code is used to solve that problem.
